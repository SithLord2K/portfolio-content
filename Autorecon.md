#### Autorecon Install Script

This is a script I created to automate the installation of Autorecon, a tool used for automated reconnaissance in penetration testing. It simplifies the setup process by handling dependencies and configurations.

The script is written in python and can be run on Kali Linux systems. This script consists of two files, autoreconinstall.py and requiredpackages.txt.

**Python Script**

```python
import os
import apt
import sys
import subprocess

#Create a list of the required packages
with open("requiredpackages.txt", "r") as file:
    required_apps = file.read().splitlines()

#Create banner
banner = """
This script will install the packages required for AutoRecon.
