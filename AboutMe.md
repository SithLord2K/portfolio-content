#### About Me
----
My journey with technology started early, sparking a lifelong passion that has taken me from computer repair to deep-dive programming. For the past seven years, Iâ€™ve honed my analytical skills as a Junior QA Analyst, where my primary role was to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in software to ensure its quality and security.

Now, I'm channeling that same passion and dedication into cybersecurity. I'm actively pursuing the TCM Security PNPT certification, a hands-on program that is sharpening my skills in ethical hacking and penetration testing. I am a quick study who enjoys developing creative solutions to complex security problems. As a collaborative team player, I'm excited to bring my unique perspective and QA background to the cybersecurity field to help organizations strengthen their security posture.
