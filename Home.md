### Welcome to my Portfolio

Hi, I'm Chris Wiley, a **cybersecurity aficionado** with nearly 30 years of IT experience. I am currently advancing my skills through TCM Security courses in ethical hacking and penetration testing, focusing on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to help organizations build a stronger security posture.

My expertise comes from both my extensive professional background and a continuous, hands-on approach to learning. This is demonstrated by my rankings in global CTF competitions and my active pursuit of the **Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT)** certification.
