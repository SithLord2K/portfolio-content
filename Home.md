#### Welcome to my portfolio.

Welcome to my Portfolio. Hi, I'm Chris Wiley, a cybersecurity aficionado with nearly 30 years of IT experience. I am taking TCM Security courses in ethical hacking and penetration testing, focusing on identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to help organizations build a stronger security posture.

My skills are a result of both my extensive professional background and a continuous, hands-on approach to learning, as demonstrated by my rankings in global CTF competitions and my active pursuit of the Practical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) certification.

The navigation menu on the left will allow you to see some of the things I have done, both in life and in my pursuit of a career in Cybersecurity.
