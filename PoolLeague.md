## About This Project

This web application was developed to modernize and replace a manual, spreadsheet-based system for a local pool league. It provides a centralized, interactive, and full-featured platform for players, captains, and administrators to manage all aspects of the league, from initial schedule creation to final season standings.

## Tech Stack

The application is built on a modern .NET stack, leveraging the following technologies:

* **Framework:** **Blazor Server** - For a rich, interactive, and stateful UI with C#.
* **UI Component Library:** **MudBlazor** - A material design component library that provides pre-built, responsive UI elements.
* **Language:** **C#** - The primary language for all front-end and back-end application logic.
* **Database:** **SQL Server** - The relational database used for all league data.
* **Authentication:** **Auth0** - For secure user authentication, management, and role-based access control.
